## Description
Implemented a blog where users can upload and delete posts and add comments. Utilized Firebase to store blog post data, such as author, post content, comments, and likes. Uses Firebase user authentication to verify user emails and encrypt passwords. Users will be able to see all posts created on the blog including posts created by other users. Users can only edit their own posts. Built with JavaScript and React framework to create, edit, delete, and comments on posts without ever refreshing the brower after the initial web page load. Used Bootstrap for styling and navigation tabs. 

## Features
### Dynamic Search Bar
Users can search for posts by title. This search bar filters through post titles and updates dynamically. 
### Likes
Users can like posts created by other user and their own posts. A user cannot like a post more than once.
