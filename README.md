Uses Firebase user authentication to verify user emails and encrypt passwords. Users will be able to all posts created on the blog including posts created by other users. Uses JavaScript and React framework to create, edit, delete, and comment on posts without ever refreshing the brower after the initial web page load. Uses Bootstrap for styling and navigation tabs. 

## Features
